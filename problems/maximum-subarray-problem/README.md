# Maximum subarray problem

## Overview

The maximum subarray problem is the problem of finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence in an array or list of numbers. Each number could be positive, negative, or zero.

Formally, the task is to find indices $i$ and $j$ such that $1 \leq i \leq j \leq n$, such that the sum $\sum_{x = i}^{j}x$ is as large as possible.
