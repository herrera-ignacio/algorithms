# The Revenue Recognition Problem

*Revenue Recognition* is a common problem in business systems. It's all about when you can actually count the money you receive on your books.

If I sell you a cup of coffee, it's a simple matter: I give you the coffee, I take your money, and I count the money to the books that nanosecond. For many things it gets complicated, however. Say you pay me a retainer to be available that year. Even if you pay me some ridiculous fee today, I may not be able to put it on my books right away because the service is to be performed over the course of a year.

> One approach might be to count only one-twelfth of that fee for each month in the year.

**The rules for _revenue recognition_ are many, various, and volatile**. Some are set by regulation, some by professional standards, and some by company policy. Revenue tracking ends up being a quite complex problem.

Imagine a company that sells three kinds of products: word processors, databases, and spreadsheets. According to the rules, when you sign a contract for a word processor you can book all the revenue right away. if it's a spreadsheet, you can book one-third today, one-third in sixty days, ad one-third in thirty days. If it's a database, you can book one-third today, one-third in thirty days, and one-third in sixty days. There's no basis for these rules other than imagination.
