# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming typically applies to optimization problems in which we make a set of choices in order to arrive at an optimal solution. As we make each choice, subproblems of the same form often arise.

Dynamic programming is efective when a given subproblem may arise from more than one partial set of choices. The key technique is to store the solution to each subproblem in case it should reappear.
