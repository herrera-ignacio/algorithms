# Greedy Algorithms

For many optimization problems, using dynamic programming to determine the best choices is overkill, simpler, more efficient algorithms will do.

A __greedy algorithm__ always makes the choice that looks best at the moment. That is, it makes a locally optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally optimal solution.

Greedy algorithms do not always yield optimal solutions, but for many problems they do.

## Top-down design

Greedy algorithms typically have a top-down design: make a choice and then solve a subproblem, rather than the bottom-up technique of solving subproblems before making a choice.
