# Data Structures

In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a __collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data__.

Sets are the fundamental data structure we seek to represent.

## Augmenting Data Structures

You can program new operations for data structures to support the desired application. Augmenting a data structure is not always straightforward, however, since the added information must be updated and maintained by the ordinary operations on the data structure.
